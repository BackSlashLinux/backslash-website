## What is BackSlash Linux?

BackSlash Linux is a polished, easy to use, beginner friendly operating system for laptop and desktop computers running AMD or Intel based 64-bit processors. The operating system tries to include most of the regularly used tools out of the box and runs on the Hardware Enabled (HWE) Linux Kernel for maximum hardware support.

BackSlash Linux is only available to be downloaded digitally and does not have any DVD or USB drive installable copies available.

## Donations, Sponsorships and Development

The project's development environment and developer events are currently not sponsored but are (again) open to support. Individual donations ensure that BackSlash Linux will remain a vibrant and free operating system.
