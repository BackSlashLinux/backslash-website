## What is BackSlash Linux?

BackSlash Linux is a polished, easy to use, beginner friendly operating system for laptop and desktop computers running AMD or Intel based 64-bit processors. The operating system tries to include most of the regularly used tools out of the box and runs on the Hardware Enabled (HWE) Linux Kernel for maximum hardware support.

The project's development environment and developer events are currently not sponsored but are (again) open to support. Individual donations ensure that BackSlash Linux will remain a vibrant and free operating system.
